# MVC-demo-website

This is a portfolio website which I build with C# and ASP.NET MVC framework. It
is not currently in use as I updated by portfolio shortly after. 

## What I Learned:
- Better C# coding skills
- How the MVC (model-view-controller) model works for web dev
- The ASP.NET framework
- Some website design and user interface
